Programming Exercise 7: K-means Clustering 
and Principal Component Analysis
=============

Introduction

In this exercise, you will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. 
In the second part, you will use principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images. 
Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watch- ing the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.
To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the exercise. 
If needed, use the cd command in Octave to change to this directory before starting this exercise.
