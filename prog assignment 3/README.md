Programming Exercise 3: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
=======================

Introduction

In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits. 
Before starting the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review 
questions for the associated topics. To get started with the exercise, download the starter code and unzip its contents 
to the directory where you wish to complete the exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave to change to this 
directory before starting this exercise.
