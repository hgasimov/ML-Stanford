function p = predictOneVsAll(all_theta, X)
%PREDICT Predict the label for a trained one-vs-all classifier. The labels 
%are in the range 1..K, where K = size(all_theta, 1). 
%  p = PREDICTONEVSALL(all_theta, X) will return a vector of predictions
%  for each example in the matrix X. Note that X contains the examples in
%  rows. all_theta is a matrix where the i-th row is a trained logistic
%  regression theta vector for the i-th class. You should set p to a vector
%  of values from 1..K (e.g., p = [1; 3; 1; 2] predicts classes 1, 3, 1, 2
%  for 4 examples) 

m = size(X, 1);
num_labels = size(all_theta, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
p = zeros(size(X, 1), 1);

% Add ones to the X data matrix
X = [ones(m, 1) X];

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
%               your learned logistic regression parameters (one-vs-all).
%               You should set p to a vector of predictions (from 1 to
%               num_labels).



% X is a [m, n+1] matrix, all_theta is a [k, n+1] matrix.
% Then h = sigmoid( X * (all_theta') ) will be a [m, k] matrix where every
% row contains probabilities of X(i,:) being one of the labels 1, ..., k

h = sigmoid(X * (all_theta'));
[maxval, p] = max(h, [], 2); % take maximum of each row to predict most probable label
