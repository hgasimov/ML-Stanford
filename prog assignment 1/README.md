Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression
===========

Introduction

In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics. To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave to change to this directory before starting this exercise. You can also find instructions for installing Octave on the “Octave In- stallation” page on the course website.

Contents:

1. Simple octave function
2. Linear regression with one variable
3. Linear regression with multiple variables
