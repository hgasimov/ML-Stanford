Programming Exercise 4: Neural Networks Learning
=========================

Introduction
In this exercise, you will implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition. 
Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.
To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the exercise. 
If needed, use the cd command in Octave to change to this directory before starting this exercise.
